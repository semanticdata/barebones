      <h2>Career Journey</h2>
      <article class="space-y-4">
        <p>
          With over 10 years of experience in construction, I have amassed
          several unique projects and experiences that cover many different
          fields. It all started when I got my first job as a Civil Engineering
          Technician for a contracting company near my university. I was at the
          time attending
          <a href="https://www.intec.edu.do/" target="_blank">INTEC</a> while pursuing
          a bachelor's in civil engineering. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish
          my college education due to personal reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, today I thrive having experience in not only public
          infrastructure, but technology, electrical, rail, and bus related
          projects as well. In the past, you could also find me working as a
          volunteer/on-call <b>Firefighter</b> for the City of Bloomington. If interested,
