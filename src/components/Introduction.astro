  <h2 class="mb-3 font-bold text-xl animate">Hi, I'm Miguel!</h2>
  <p class="animate">
    I’m a problem solver, hobby developer, music enthusiast, and public
    infrastructure advocate based in Minnesota, US. I’m passionate about using
    technology and creative thinking to tackle challenges, whether it's building
    better websites or designing efficient urban systems.

    With a background in engineering project management and a self-taught love
    for coding, I enjoy blending my technical knowledge with curiosity-driven
    side projects. When I’m not working, you’ll find me learning new programming
    languages, experimenting with web development, or digging into the latest
    trends in public infrastructure.

  <p class="animate">
    I think a lot, work hard, occasionally have existential crises, and know
    just enough about making websites to make things interesting. While I love
    writing, coding, and listening to music, my true motivation lies in finding
    elegant solutions to complex problems.
